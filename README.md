## Rules/guidelines for developers
### Mergin to main branch
Before merging to main, always merge to beta. If merge to beta is successful, then merge beta to main. This is to protect the main branch.
### Naming convention for branches
name-year-month-date-version
F. ex: joffen-2023-02-16-a, joffen-2023-02-16-b
We use a, b, c etc. to keep track of branches made the same day by the same user.
